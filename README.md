#Chitinous Crooks - Day 5 Status Update

##The Story so Far

* **Saturday:** Suddenly realize it is the week of the 7drl challenge.
* **Sunday:** Never made a game before. No detailed plans. Decide to try anyway. Start coding at around 11:30 at night...
* **Monday (Day 1):** Have been working on a js project recently so I feel like I have momentum. I'll use RoT.js.
* Use the tutorial at Coding Cookies to get a foundation. Strip out stuff I don't need like inventory and experience.
* Start on gameplay idea based loosely on card games. You randomly draw a hand of cards (prayers, spells).  You can only 'play' so many per turn/level/whatever. Not straying too far for basic roguelike gameplay as I'm expecting a lot of effort just to make a game that works.
* Got an @ in a dungeon.
* **Tuesday:** I need a theme. Anything but goblins. I dunno, lobsterfolk? Sure. Sounds good.  Ooh, and they can have an Atlantissy dungeon. And the player's god and abilities can be sea themed.  Okay, this works.
* Add a few lobsterfolk enemies and start working on abilities system.
* **Wednesday** Didn't have a lot of time today. Implement a few abilities.
* **Thursday** Implement more abilities.

##To do in the next 3 days

* A few more abilities.
* Some less boring enemies.
* Rewrite most of the ability names.
* Win condition
* Victory Screen
* Failure Screen
* Graphics (Optional)
