## Intro
**Chitinous Crooks** is a roguelike game made in seven days for the 2015 [7DRL Challenge](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Seven_Day_Roguelike_Challenge). It's a very traditional roguelike in both gameplay and aesthetics. But you have no experience levels or items to help you, just a random set of god-granted abilities. Each dungeon level, you can use up to three of these, and every time you pass a level your health is restored and you gain additional abilities to choose from.

Special thanks goes to [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) and the [tutorial at the Coding Cookies blog](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/).

## 7DRL Challenge History

* **Saturday:** Suddenly realize it is the week of the 7drl challenge.
* **Sunday:** Never made a game before. No detailed plans. Decide to try anyway. Start coding at around 11:30 pm...
* **Monday (Day 1):** Have been working on another js project recently so I feel like I have momentum. I'll use RoT.js.
* Use the tutorial at Coding Cookies to get a foundation. Strip out stuff I don't need like inventory and experience.
* Start on gameplay idea based loosely on card games. You randomly draw a hand of cards (prayers, spells).  You can only 'play' so many per turn/level/whatever. Not straying too far for basic roguelike gameplay as I'm expecting a lot of effort just to make a game that works.
* Got an @ in a dungeon.
* **Tuesday:** I need a theme. Anything but goblins. I dunno, lobsterfolk? Sure. Sounds good.  Ooh, and they can have an Atlantissy dungeon. And the player's god and abilities can be sea themed.  Okay, this works.
* Add a few lobsterfolk enemies and start working on abilities system.
* **Wednesday:** Didn't have a lot of time today. Implement a few abilities.
* **Thursday:** Implement more abilities.
* **Friday:** Didn't get a chance to work on the game.
* **Saturday:** Add crabfolk and snails.
* Add win and lose screens.
* **Sunday (Day 7):** Final abilities. 
* Testing. 
* Bug fixing. 
* Add touchscreen controls. 
* Game finished around 10:40 pm.
